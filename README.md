# Dog Encyclopedia React Project

Author: Haoting Shen

I created an educational and interactive website designed to engage users with comprehensive information about dogs. Users will have the opportunity to explore a wide range of dog breeds, discover their traits, and learn fascinating facts about them.

Github Pages: https://HaotingShen.github.io/dog-encyclopedia/

API: https://dogapi.dog/docs/api-v2

**Note (September 23, 2025):** Due to Dog API changes, this site intentionally shows and searches only a curated set of breeds with local images to preserve the original behavior.
